# EntityFinder

A very useful mod made, so you can easily find entities.

**I WILL NOT TAKE RESPONSIBILITY IF YOU GET BANNED FOR USING THIS MOD. SOME SERVERS MIGHT CONSIDER IT AN UNFAIR ADVANTAGE**

### How to use

- `/finder find <selector>`: highlight some entities
- `/finder hide <selector>`: stops highlighting some entities

- `/finder settings <setting_name> <setting_value>`: change settings

### Known Issues

Tracers are somewhat offcenter when having the [View Bobbing] option enabled
