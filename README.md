# PlayerFinder

A very useful mod made, so you can easily find your friends! (Your enemies as well)

**I WILL NOT TAKE RESPONSIBILITY IF YOU GET BANNED FOR USING THIS MODE. SOME SERVERS MIGHT CONSIDER IT AN UNFAIR ADVANTAGE**

### How to use

Commands:

- `/find <playername>`: highlight a specific player
- `/unfind <playername>`: no longer highlight a specific player
- `/findlist`: see who is being highlighted
- `/findall`: highlight everyone
- `/finddistance <min> <max>`: set the minimum and maximum highlighting distance

### Known Issues
